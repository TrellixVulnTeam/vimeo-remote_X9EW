# vimeo-remote
Beaen is a web application that can remotely control the playback of 360 video.  With a backend built with Python Flask and Flask-SocketIO, it receives a ‘start’ command from one webpage and broadcasts a ‘start’ message to all connected users. The listeners use A-Frame, a WebVR framework, to view the video.  These users have no control over the playback of the video, so at events we can have a group viewing of the same video using Google Cardboard.  Though we have tried using Vimeo API and Youtube Player API, these platforms still have shortcomings in providing the technology for our purposes. Until we find a suitable content delivery network (CDN), a locally self-hosted video is in use.
